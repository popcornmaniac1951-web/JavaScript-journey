🎯 Assignment #1 — Build a Professional Prompt Template

You are going to design a reusable prompt template for:

Reviewing your PHP Expense Tracker project.

This is not a random prompt.
This should look like something a company would actually use internally.

🧩 Your Prompt MUST Include
1️⃣ Role Definition

Assign AI a clear identity.

Example direction (don’t copy — build your own):

Act as a senior backend engineer with 10+ years of experience in PHP, MySQL, and web security.

2️⃣ Context Section

Explain what the project is.

Example structure:

Project purpose

Tech stack

What features it includes

What stage it is in (MVP / production-ready)

3️⃣ Clear Task Instructions

Tell the AI to:

Analyze code quality

Detect security vulnerabilities

Identify performance bottlenecks

Suggest structural improvements

Suggest scalability improvements

Flag bad practices

4️⃣ Force Structured Output

Very important.

Tell it to return response in this format:

Executive Summary

Security Issues (with severity levels: Low / Medium / High / Critical)

Performance Issues

Code Quality Review

Scalability Risks

Improvement Recommendations

Refactored Example (if needed)

Structured thinking = professional prompting.

5️⃣ Add Constraints

For example:

If insufficient information, say “Insufficient Information.”

Do not assume missing architecture.

Do not generate unnecessary code unless requested.

Be concise but precise.

Constraints = control.

🧠 Why This Matters

When you build prompts like this, you are:

Thinking like a system architect

Reducing hallucinations

Increasing output reliability

Practicing structured engineering thinking

This improves your coding brain directly.

ROLE:
act as a senior backend engineer with 10+ years of experience in PHP,MySQL and web security 

CONTEXT:
my project name is expense tracker.i used html,css,and js for frend end and backend using php and the data base is MySQL.
mainly it is a daily usable expense tracking web application.by this application a user can register to it and make a account in it.
then he can add his expenses and incomes .so by adding expenses and incomes he can analyse his finaltial state and make good desicions to manage money.
he can filter data through daily,monthly,yearly wise.that is the project .currently the frendend section is complete and backend also complete .mysql 
works well.admin panel also added for user management.so basically production of the project is complete 

TASK:
 Analyze code quality

Detect security vulnerabilities

=========================GoodOne==========================

ROLE:
Act as a senior backend architect and security auditor with 10+ years of experience in PHP, MySQL,
 secure web application design, and OWASP Top 10 compliance. Think critically and evaluate both code-level and architectural decisions.

CONTEXT:
Project Name: Expense Tracker

Purpose:
A daily-use financial tracking web application allowing users to:
- Register and authenticate accounts
- Add, edit, and delete expenses and income
- Filter records by daily, monthly, and yearly views
- View aggregated financial summaries
- Admin panel for user management

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP (procedural/MVC specify if applicable)
- Database: MySQL
- Authentication: (Specify if using sessions, JWT, etc.)
- Password Hashing: (Specify method if known)
- Deployment: (Local / Shared Hosting / VPS – if applicable)

Project Status:
Feature-complete and considered production-ready.

TASK:
Perform a comprehensive technical audit covering:

1. Code Quality Assessment
2. Security Vulnerability Detection (aligned with OWASP Top 10)
3. Performance Bottleneck Analysis
4. Architectural Design Review
5. Scalability Evaluation
6. Best Practice Violations
7. Maintainability & Technical Debt Review

Prioritize critical issues first.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Executive Summary (overall risk level and maturity assessment)

2. Security Issues
   - Issue Description
   - Severity Level (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
   - Exploitation Risk Scenario
   - Recommended Fix

3. Performance Issues
   - Root Cause
   - Impact Level
   - Optimization Recommendation

4. Code Quality Review
   - Strengths
   - Weaknesses
   - Maintainability Score (1-10 with reasoning)

5. Scalability Risks
   - Short-Term Risks
   - Long-Term Growth Concerns

6. Improvement Roadmap
   - Immediate Fixes (Quick Wins)
   - Medium-Term Improvements
   - Long-Term Architectural Enhancements

7. Optional Refactored Code Example (Only if critical improvement required)

CONSTRAINTS:
- If insufficient information is provided, state “Insufficient Information.”
- Do not assume missing architecture.
- Do not fabricate vulnerabilities.
- Do not rewrite the entire project unless critical.
- Keep analysis precise and technically rigorous.
