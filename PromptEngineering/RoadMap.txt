🧭 6-Month Prompt Engineering Roadmap (Developer-Focused)

We’re going to build this in layers — foundation → control → systems → automation.

🔹 MONTH 1: Cognitive Foundations

Objective: Understand how LLMs think so you can control outputs.

Study:

Tokens & context window

Temperature & determinism

Zero-shot vs Few-shot

Chain-of-thought reasoning

Hallucination patterns

Instruction hierarchy

Understand ecosystem players:

OpenAI

Anthropic

Google DeepMind

You don’t need research-level depth.
You need architectural awareness.

📌 Weekly Output Requirement

By end of Month 1 you must create:

10 structured prompt templates

5 debugging prompts

3 code-review prompts

2 constraint-controlled prompts

No theory-only learning. We ship every week.

🔹 MONTH 2: Developer Prompt Systems

Now we connect this directly to your coding growth.

You will build reusable templates for:

Secure authentication generation

Database schema design

MVC architecture planning

Performance optimization

Edge-case test generation

Refactoring for scalability

This is where your backend skill accelerates.

🔹 MONTH 3: Prompt Architecture & Chaining

You stop writing single prompts.

You start building pipelines:

Analyze problem

Design architecture

Generate code

Critique output

Optimize

Produce documentation

That’s prompt orchestration.

🔹 MONTH 4–6: Professional Level

Now we move into system thinking:

Guardrails

Output validation

JSON enforcement

Role isolation

Error recovery prompts

Tool-augmented prompting

This is how production AI systems are built.

🧠 Let Me Reset Your Identity

You are not becoming:

“A guy who writes better ChatGPT questions.”

You are becoming:

“An engineer who designs AI-powered development workflows.”

That’s a market-differentiating skill set.

And yes — this will drastically improve your coding clarity.
