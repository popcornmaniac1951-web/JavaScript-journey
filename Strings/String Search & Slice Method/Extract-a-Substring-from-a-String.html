    <script>

        // slice(start, end) from 0 to before 4
        let text = "Hello World Its me";
        let res = text.slice(0, 4);
        console.log(res);

        let vehicle = "Bmw m5 cs f90";
        let gear = vehicle.slice(0, 3);
        console.log(gear);

        let movie = "Ready player one";
        let mov = movie.slice(0, 5);
        console.log(mov);

        // In this example, slice(0, 5) extracts characters starting from index 0 up to but not including index 5. As a result, the word Hello is extracted.
        // If you omit the second parameter, slice() will extract everything from the start index to the end of the string:
        let world ="india is my country";
        let ind = world.slice(1);
        console.log(ind);

        let word = "javascript is a programming language";
        let pgn = word.slice(-1);
        let pgm = word.slice(-2);
        console.log(pgn);
        console.log(pgm);
